            <li>5) Report to relevant regulatory authorities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>4. You should properly safeguard your account and password. Losses caused by users disclosing account information, allowing others to use the account, or failing to take timely security measures (including but not limited to data misuse, asset loss, legal liability, etc.) shall be borne by the user.

        </ul>
        <p>3. Points usage rules:</p>

            <li>Points are consumed in order of expiration date, with soon-to-expire points used first;</li>
            <li>Points with the same expiration date are consumed in order of issuance date, with earlier issued points consumed first;</li>
            <li>Points that never expire are consumed last;</li>

        <p>3. Family points sharing rules:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Family members can share the owner's points for feature consumption;</li>

            <li>The owner can only consume their own points and cannot consume other members' points;</li>
            <li>Points earned by each person are still stored in their own account and will not automatically transfer to the owner.</li>
